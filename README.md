# Summary
This project is an 'autonomous' car that can navigate using a Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic distance sensor. Implemented in python, the car evaluates the distance to the closest wall and performs specific operations if the wall is too near.

# Hardware
The circuit schematic used is as follows:

In addition, a cheap remote controlled car was dismantled and reused for this project. The terminals of the car's power supply were unsoldered and repurposed as a 4.5 V power supply.
